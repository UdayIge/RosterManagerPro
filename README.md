# Roster Management System

A small Next.js + React application that visualizes provider rosters and availabilities in a list and week calendar view. The project uses Redux Toolkit for state, Tailwind for styling, and includes a mock dataset in `public/mock/roster.json`.

## Features
- Fetches provider data and shows session / calendar views
- Week-based calendar grid with time slots and events
- Simple search and service filter (Online / Offline / Blocked / All)
- Mock Google Calendar events for demonstration

## Tech stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- React 19
- Redux Toolkit (+ react-redux)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

## Quick start (Windows / PowerShell)
From the project root (`roster-management-system`):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev script runs `next dev --turbopack` as configured in `package.json`.

## Important files
- `src/app/page.tsx` — main page, toggles list/calendar views and dispatches provider fetch
- `src/store/providerSlice.ts` — Redux slice; contains `fetchProviders` thunk
- `public/mock/roster.json` — sample provider data used by the app
- `src/lib/events.ts` — converts provider availabilities into calendar events
- `src/lib/current-week-dates.ts` — builds the week (Sunday→Saturday) from a base date
- `src/lib/time.ts` — generates time rows for the calendar grid
- `src/components/Calender/CalendarView.tsx` — calendar grid renderer

## How the calendar works (short)
1. `CalendarMainArea` computes `weekDates` (7 Date objects) using `getWeekDates(baseDate)`.
2. Events are generated with `generateEventsFromProviders(...)` for each date and combined with mock Google events from `generateMockGoogleEvents(...)`.
3. `CalendarView` renders a grid of time rows (generated by `generateTimeSlots`) and 7 day columns. For each cell it looks for an event whose `day` (YYYY-MM-DD) and `start` (HH:MM) match the row and column and renders the first match.

Notes:
- Events use 15-minute durations, while the grid interval is configurable via `generateTimeSlots`. To align events and rows, ensure the grid interval matches the event start granularity (e.g., 15 minutes).
- The calendar currently renders only the first event that matches a cell (if multiple events share the same start/time they will collide).

## Development notes & suggestions
- If `fetchProviders` fails, ensure an API route exists at `/api/roster`. The app ships with `public/mock/roster.json`; you can add a simple Next.js route `src/app/api/roster/route.ts` to return that JSON for local dev.
- Consider making event IDs unique per event (e.g. `${provider.id}-${date}-${start}`) to avoid collisions.
- To display multiple events per cell, change the lookup from `.find(...)` to `.filter(...)` and render a stacked list inside the cell.
